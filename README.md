<b><h2><center>The code that I'm using to display temperatures and the status of my  garage as well as a button to activeate the garage door</center></h1></b>

Using this [awesome code](https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/ESP32_WebPage) from [KrisKasprzak](https://github.com/KrisKasprzak), I've creadted a static web page that displays the current temperatures of the freezer in my garage, the ambient temerature in my garage and the outside temerature. I've also set up 2 hall effect sensors to show me whether the  garage door is fully open, fully  closed or somewhere in between.

The best part is that I've added a optocoupler relay to activate the garage door. As I've got a personal VPN sut up, All I need to do to  connec to that with my phone, and I can close my garage door (or open it to give someone access), frmo anywhere in the world with ineternet access.
